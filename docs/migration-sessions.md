# HarflowDesign migration sessions — native revision 3

Revised 2026-11-04. The [workspace session index](../../HARFLOW_MIGRATION_SESSIONS.md)
is authoritative for each brief, prerequisites, acceptance and receipt output.
Read [repository checklist](migration-plan.md) and applicable guidance before work.

## Current ownership

M01/M01-Gxx and every native feature design/acceptance; W01/W03/W04 and late Windows.

- **WIN01 — Late Windows scope and framework**; prerequisites and acceptance in the workspace index.
- **WIN03 — Native C# application**; prerequisites and acceptance in the workspace index.
- **WIN04 — Windows release and stability gate**; prerequisites and acceptance in the workspace index.

Each assignment is bounded and stops before the next. Record its lead receipt in
`docs/migration-receipts/<ID>.md`; co-owned work is included in that lead receipt.
No plan status authorizes live operations or publication. All new sessions are planned.

## Historical session evidence

S01–S09 keep their original IDs, outputs and recorded limits. S09 bounded evidence
is delivered, not accepted. Historical future S10–S50/X01–X03 are superseded and cannot be dispatched;
see the [crosswalk](../../HARFLOW_MIGRATION_PLAN_V3.md#supersession-and-scope-crosswalk).
The preserved briefs below describe original scope, not new authorization.
